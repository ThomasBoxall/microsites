# TODO

## Development
* Test with HTML kitchen sink: https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/JpLzjd
* Links on the multisite site
* Responsivity on Mobile

## CDN Deployment Things
* Colours
* Favicons - these will be hosted on the CDN and pulled in that way
  * Consider having these be coloured squares (in match with the theme colours)
  * Or a icon of some sort
