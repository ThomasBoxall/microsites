# TODO

## Development
* error pages - make these work properly with ssi etc
* add callouts, maybe an info, warning, any more?
* add basic text stlying to be used in `<span>`s (bf, it, ul, etc)

## CDN Deployment Things
* Colours
* Favicons - these will be hosted on the CDN and pulled in that way
  * Consider having these be coloured squares (in match with the theme colours)
  * Or a icon of some sort
